Why should we use validation?
a validationis a controllerr/middleware to chcek formdata such as validate an email before it gets stored in the database. The input can either be rejcted or allowed.

How to validate:
we can validte on the clinet side. i.e using javascript(optional). Not very secure solution, only useful for user experience.
we can validate on the server side(more secure as code cant be seen by the user its only on the server.).

there is a built-in validation on some database like mongoDb.

To use validation, there is a third party package you can use. (express-validator). use npm install  --save express-validator

you can also write your own custom validation.
