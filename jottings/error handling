You cant avoid errors. there are different types: 
Technical/network errors e.g server down.
Bugs/logical errors i.e errors in our code. e.g user object used when it doesnt exist., fixed during development. its is our fault
Expected errors e.g database operation fails, inform user, possibly retry



Working with errors:
-You can throw an error: there are tools we can usee.g try,catch block for synchronous, and then and catch for asynchronous.
 we can directing handle the error or we can use a special express middleware.

No error is thrown:
we have to validate values to throw an error or directly handle the error.


To handle errors in your application you can add a page represnting 500 error(indicating an error in the database) or other Technical issues.


There is a special error handling middleware in express js which takes in four arguements.

in async code you have to use next wrapping the error.


HTTP STATUS CODE:
The codes are extra information passed to the data, that tells the browser if an action suceeded or not. theya are of different types;
200; success
300; redirection
400; client-side error.
500; server-side error.

setting status codes does not mean that the response is incomplete or the app crashed.

Types of errors and handling Errors:
You can differntiate between different type of errors - Technical errors(which are thrown) and "Expected errors" (e.g invalid user input).
Error handling can be done with custom if-checks, try-catch, then()-catch().
You can use the express error handling middleware to handle alll unhandled errors.
